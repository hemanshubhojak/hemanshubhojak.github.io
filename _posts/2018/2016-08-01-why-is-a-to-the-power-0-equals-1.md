Let's find powers of 2
```
2^-3 = 1/8
2^-2 = 2 * 1/8 = 1/4
2^-1 = 2 * 1/4 = 1/2
2^0  = 2 * 1/2 = 1 <- This is why
2^1  = 2 * 1   = 2
2^2  = 2 * 2   = 4
2^3  = 2 * 4   = 8
```
In the above example we **multiply** by **2** as we move down.


Let's do that in reverse

```
2^4  = 16
2^3  = 16/2   = 8
2^2  = 8/2    = 4
2^1  = 4/2    = 2
2^0  = 2/2    = 1 <- This is why
2^-1 = 1/2    = 0.5
2^-2 = 1/2*2  = 0.25
2^-3 = 1/2*4  = 0.125
```

In the above example we **divide** by **2** as we move down.
